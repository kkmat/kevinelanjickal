              <h3>The Programme</h3>
              <p>
                In October 2013, 18 students from Kuwait English School travelled to South Africa to complete the Gold level of the International Award (Duke of Edinburgh). The programme combined a multi-day wilderness expedition in the Cederberg mountains with a residential community service project in Paarl, Western Cape.
              </p>
              <p>
                As <strong>charity leader</strong> of the group, I was responsible for coordinating the fundraising campaign, managing the allocation of funds, and leading the team through the residential service component.
              </p>

              <h3>The Expedition</h3>
              <p>
                The expedition began with a road trip from Cape Town to Algeria (a small town in the Cederberg), where the group met their guides for final briefings and equipment checks. The multi-day hike took us over mountain terrain in variable weather — intermittent rain, cold nights, and physically demanding trails that tested everyone's endurance. Every one of the 18 students completed the expedition successfully.
              </p>
              <p>
                Between the expedition and the residential project, the group had a recuperation day touring Cape Town — visiting Seal Island by boat, the Cape of Good Hope, and Boulders Beach to see the penguin colonies.
              </p>

              <h3>The Khanyise Day Care Centre</h3>
              <p>
                The Khanyise Day Care Centre in Paarl housed <strong>32 children aged 0 to 6</strong> in extremely cramped conditions — a tiny house with very little outdoor play space. A temporary structure on the property had been destroyed during recent storms, and the centre was working towards building a purpose-built facility through the Nedbank Care Project.
              </p>

              <h3>What We Raised</h3>
              <p>
                Through student-driven fundraising efforts back in Kuwait, the group raised approximately <strong>£1,300 GBP (~R22,000)</strong>. These funds were used to provide:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Staple food supplies to feed the children for at least a week</li>
                <li>Electricity for the centre</li>
                <li>Educational supplies, toys, and books</li>
                <li>A teddy bear for every child — some of whom had never owned a toy before</li>
                <li><strong>R10,620 donated directly to the Centre's building fund</strong> for reconstruction</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Additional support came from sponsors including Advance Future Group International, Aroma and Safari, Al Zayani, and an anonymous donor. The South African ambassador also pledged R5,000 from his family.
              </p>

              <h3>Planning & Preparation</h3>
              <p>
                The evening before our first visit, the team sat together brainstorming what the centre actually needed — not what we assumed, but what would make a real difference. Early the next morning, three of us headed to Classic Wholesalers with a trailer, thanks to Mr Sheldon who allowed us to shop there. We loaded up with staple foods, educational supplies, toys, and hula hoops — which turned out to be the undisputed favourite.
              </p>

              <h3>What We Did</h3>
              <p>
                The team spent several days at the centre, organising and delivering a full programme of activities for the children:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Prepared and served picnic lunches</li>
                <li>Led sing-alongs, circle time, and storytelling sessions (including stories in Xhosa)</li>
                <li>Organised aerobics, hula hoop games, and outdoor play</li>
                <li>Ran arts and crafts workshops</li>
                <li>Supervised nap times and general childcare</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When we gave out the teddy bears — one for every child — some needed to be shown how to hug them. Having their own toy appeared to be entirely outside the realm of their experience. Extra bears were left at the centre for new arrivals. The team also distributed the bears personally; students like Naomi, Diksha, Sune, and Saif handed them out one by one.
              </p>

              <h3>Ubuntu</h3>
              <p>
                The residential project was built around the concept of <strong>Ubuntu</strong> — an African philosophy often translated as <em>"I am because we are."</em> It speaks to the idea that our humanity is bound up in the humanity of others. That ethos defined everything we did at Khanyise. It wasn't about charity in the traditional sense — it was about showing up, being present, and forming real human connections.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the moment we arrived, the children welcomed us without hesitation. By the end, many a little one would not let go of our students — and our students were just as reluctant to leave. On our final visit, the children greeted us with clapping, jumping, and hugs. There were lots of tears and clinging on both sides; some students had to be dragged away.
              </p>

              <h3>The Impact</h3>
              <p>
                The group continued fundraising after returning to Kuwait, committed to helping the centre reach its goal of a purpose-built facility through the Nedbank Care Project. As the blog post written after the trip put it: <em>"We are all back home, safe and sound. Thank you to everyone that made our time in South Africa so incredible. We've left part of ourselves in Africa."</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                This remains one of the most meaningful experiences of my life — a vivid reminder of what a small group of determined people can achieve when they commit to something bigger than themselves.
              </p>
